TODO: 
- animation trigger (and stay) on scroll
  - and then disable that animation unless component gets out of screen (back to beyond
    bottom)
- round containers (with linear gradient) that have image of my work on eitherl left/right
  and text on the other side 
    - animation: trigger:
      - initially clipped by small circle, expands to rounded square while moving to
        left/right, while text's opacity goes from 0-1
      - container's bg goes from 0-1 opac, and when reached specific scroll pos, 
        pop (scale to 1.2 then back to 1) animation trigger 
          - *** this pop will not re-trigger unless the user has scrolled up the 
            container out of screen --> how to do this? 
            - keep var isReset (boolean), and use this as part of logic inside 
              useLayoutEffect where you determine the scroll pos and trigger 
              animation (check whether animation isReset --> it resets when cmp 
              y pos is lower than curr height and is off-screen):
              var elem = document.querySelector('#some-element');
              var bounding = elem.getBoundingClientRect();
              if (bounding.top < 0) {	// Top is out of viewport }
      - upon pop, wave ripple that slowly fades:
        - opac dec over time
        - have child that has another child --> first child is the ripple,
          second child is transparent but somehow blocks the center area of 
          first child
        - scale the first child while its opac decreases 
- progress bar at top (sticky, right below header text), (this also uses scrollmagic?)
